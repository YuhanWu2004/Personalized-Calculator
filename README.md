# Personalized-Calculator
This is an application of the Tkinter module in Python. By using the button widget in the Tkinter module, I created a digital calculator with clickable buttons that can be personalized in many ways.

A calculator that can run basic calculations is built by constructing different buttons that correspond to different calculations and functions that a basic calculator has.

The calculator can compute addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It can process integers and decimal numbers.

It has a window for users to input numbers, and after clicking the "=" button, the answer to the calculation will show up in the window. 

Besides the four buttons to perform the four types of calculations, it has a "clear" button, an "=" button, a decimal button, and 10 buttons for numbers 0-9.

I personalized the calculator so that it has different colors for different types of buttons.
